# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
    - Very confident.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - This definitely rang a lot of bells from the Try Coding workshop as well as some of my self-taught coding experience. I'm very familiar with using google to problem solve so going beyond what was included in the lesson wasn't an issue. I definitely had productive struggle in study hall when a couple members in the group were further along in the assignment than I was but talking with them aleviated all unproductive struggle I would have had.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I believe I learned all the concepts in this lesson thoroughly.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - I attempted to create a challenge 4 since we tackled most of the assignment together in group study hall. I tried to combine most of the conditions from all the exercises in the for lesson into one challenge but couldn't get the methods to all work correctly on a single line. I then realized how late it was and decided to table it in favor of turning in the assignment only moderately late. My main question is how can I run multiple methods on array values without having to create new variables for each output? I will try to get the answers from Google but may have to ask in the group lesson tomorrow.
